# Introduction
This is a rest crud api for accessing inventory data that is persisted in a database

# Requirements
1. You must have .NET Core 7 SDK installed on your machine. Here, I will the dotnet CLI commands. [see here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
2. Install the entity framework cli tools. [see here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#installing-the-tools) 
3. You must have MySQL installed and setup on your machine. 

# Setting up This Project
Do the following steps:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open API/appsettings.json and replace the connection string there with that of your database
3. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project
4. To apply the migrations to your database enter the following command in the terminal:

       dotnet ef database update --startup-project Startup --project Domain
    > Note: the migration will pre populate your database with objects, so you can immediately begin using the GET endpoints.

5. To run the program, enter this command in the terminal:

        dotnet run --project Startup

# Endpoints

> Note: If you have postman in your machine, you can import InventoryDb.postman_collection.json to run prewritten sample requests.
